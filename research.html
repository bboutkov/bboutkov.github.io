            <h1>Geometric Multigrid Solver for Unstructured Finite Elements</h1>

            <br>
            <p align="left"> Recently I've spent good chunk of time
              implementing and studying the efficacy of utilizing
              geometric multigrid (GMG) for solving partial differential
              equations (PDEs) on unstructured grids distributed over
              arbitrary processor counts.</p>

            <br>

            <p align="left"> Geometric multigrid is regarded as a
            particularly effective solution technique; it's
            algorithmically optimal ($O(n)$) in both memory
            requirements, as well as computational cost. Furthermore,
            if one employs load balanced domain decomposition
            techniques GMG retains its optimal properties under
            parallelization. The overall methodology operates by
            smoothing the solution errors (or residuals) on a collection
            of coarser sub-problems whose information can then be used
            to repeatedly solve the originally desired fine grid
            problem in a highly efficient fashion. The method is
            algorithmically scaleable, and it converges to the
            solution in a fixed number of iterations that is
            independent of the mesh resolution.

            A key aspect and difficulty of such a technique is the
            development of an implementation in an efficient, parallel
            manner which is independent of the input parameters to the
            PDE which is to be solved. As such, much of the solver
            infrastructure related to this research is implemented in
            the open source
            <a href="http://libmesh.github.io">
              libMesh finite element library</a>, while examples of the
            optimality of the technique for more complex examples were
            demonstrated in
            the <a href="http://grinsfem.github.io">GRINS</a>
            multiphysics application built on top of libMesh.</p>

            <br>
            <p align="left">
            In order to better understand the method we can define a
            sequence of grids denoted $\{G_i\}$, and we denote by
            $\#G_i$ the number of mesh elements within a given grid
            $G_i$. For simplicity we assume that this grid sequence is
            ordered based on the count of the finite elements so that
            we have: $\#G_f >... > \#G_i > ... > \#G_c$ where we adopt
            the notation so that $G_f$ and $G_c$ correspond
            respectively to the finest and coarsest grids. </p>

            <br>

            <p align="left"> The libMesh library is then used to
            partition the domain between processors, refine the mesh,
            and then manage local-to-global degree of freedom
            information as well as ghosted element info which must be
            periodically communicated between processors. The
            following diagram attempts to depict these steps in an
            abstracted manner.</p>

            <img src="imgs/partitioning_refinement.svg"
                 alt="Partitioning and Refinement Example"
                 width="600" align="center">

            <br>
            <p align="left"> Upon establishing the grid hierarchy the
            multigrid technique utilizes the degree of freedom map
            managed by libMesh to construct projection and
            interpolation operators which become fundamental pieces
            allowing the algorithm to transfer information between
              grids.</p>

             <p align="left"> As a simple example of the solver in
            action we can
            consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_equation">
            Poisson's equation</a>, the prototypical elliptic PDE
            which models diffusive processes. Poisson's equation has a
            strong formulation given by: </p>

              $$\nabla u = b(x)$$.

            <p align="left"> where $b(x)$ is some specified function.
            For a simple scenario we can select a square domain with
            insulated boundaries alongside an internal forcing with a
            heat source given by: </p>

            $$b(x) = 2\pi^2 \sin(\pi x)\sin(\pi y)$$.

            <p align="left"> This gives rise to a solution as depicted
            in the following: </p>

            <br>

            <img src="imgs/forced_2d.svg" alt="2D Forced Poisson solution">

            <br>

            <p align="left"> As expected, this gives rise to optimal
              convergence rates which we can inspect by comparing our
              computed solution to an exact solution generated via the
              method of manufactured solutions. As we can see, one
              application of FMG produces a solution on the order of
              the discretization error. </p>

            <img src="imgs/vcycle_vs_fmg.svg" alt="V cycles vs FMG convergence">

            <p align="left"> We can similarly study more exotic
            physics. For example here we consider thermally driven
            flow which incorporates a Boussinesq buoyancy
            approximation which couples an energy balance equation to
            that of the incompressible Navier Stokes equations. In the
            figure below we can observe the formation of thermal
            vortexes, a phenomena which is particularly difficult for
            black box solvers to resolve. </p>

            $$
            \begin{aligned}
            \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t} + (\boldsymbol{u} \cdot \nabla)\boldsymbol{u} &- \mu \nabla^2 \boldsymbol{u} + \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p = - \beta \textbf{g} T \\
            \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u} &= 0 \\
            \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{u}\cdot \nabla T &- \nabla \cdot (k\nabla  T) = \frac{J}{\rho c_p}
            \end{aligned}
            $$

                 width="600"  align="center">

            <p align="left"> We can also apply these ideas to
            elastodynamics problems.  </p>

            $$
            \begin{aligned}
            \rho_0 \ddot{\boldsymbol{\phi}} = \nabla^\textbf{X} \cdot [\textbf{P(F)}] &+ \rho_0 \textbf{b}_m \quad \text{ in } B\times (0,\tau) \\
            \boldsymbol{\phi} &= \textbf{g} \quad \text{ in } \Gamma_d \times (0,\tau) \\
            \textbf{P(F)}\textbf{N} &= \textbf{h} \quad \text{ in } \Gamma_n \times (0,\tau) \\
            \boldsymbol{\phi} (\cdot,0) &= \textbf{X} \quad \text{ in } B \\
            \dot{\boldsymbol{\phi}} (\cdot,0) &= \textbf{V}_0 \quad \text{ in } B
            \end{aligned}
            $$

            <p align="left"> In the above formulation $B$ represents
            the reference configuration and $\textbf{X}$ corresponds
            to the Lagrangian coordinate system. Furthermore,
            $\textbf{P(F)}$ is the first Piola-Kirchoff frame
            indifferent stress response function having $\textbf{F} =
            \nabla^\textbf{X}\boldsymbol{\phi}$, $\rho_0$ is the
            reference mass density, $\textbf{b}_m$ is the material
            description of a specified spatial body force field per
            unit mass, $\textbf{N}$ is the outward unit normal field
            on $\partial B$, and $\textbf{g,h,V}_0$ are assigned
            fields. </p>

            <p align="left"> Of course there are many possible further
            applications of such a technique which can be explored
            through the introduction of different domains, boundary
            conditions, and couplings between various physics. Having
            the ability to explore such scenarios from the command
            line provides a very fast and robust method for modeling
            and investigating the behavior and dynamics of various
            problems of interest. </p>
