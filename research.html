            <h1>Geometric Multigrid Solver for Unstructured Finite Elements</h1>

            <br>
            <p align="left"> Recently I've spent good chunk of time
              implementing and studying the effecacy of utilizing
              geometric multigrid for solving partial differential
              equations (PDEs) on unstructured grids.</p>

            <br>

            <p align="left"> Geometric Multigrid is a particularly
            effective solution technique; it's an algorithmically
            optimal ( $O(n)$ ) solution technique, in both memory
            requirements as well as computational cost, and lends
            itself naturally to parallelization via domain
            decomposition. The technique operates by smoothing the
            solution errors on a series of coarser sub-problems whose
            information can then be used to repeatedly solve the
            originally desired fine grid problem in a highly efficient
            fashion. The method is algorithmically scaleable, and it
            converges to the solution in a fixed number of iterations
            that is independent of the mesh resolution.

            The key aspect and difficulty of such a technique is
            implementing it in an efficient, parallel manner which is
            independent of the input parameters. As such, much of the
            solver infrastructure was implemented in the open source
            libMesh library while examples of the optimality of the
            technique were demonstrated in the GRINS multiphysics
            application built on top of libMesh.

            We begin by defining a sequence of grids $\{G_i\}$, and we
            denote by $\#G_i$ the number of mesh elements within a
            given grid $G_i$. For simplicity we assume that these
            grids are ordered based on their element count so that we
            have: $\#G_f >... > \#G_i > ... > \#G_c$ where we adopt
            the notation so that $G_f$ and $G_c$ correspond
            respectively to the finest and coarsest grids. </p>

            <br>

            <p align="left"> libMesh is used to partition the domain
            amongst processors, refine the mesh, and then manage
            local-to-global degree of freedom information as well as
            ghosted element info which must be periodically
            communicated amongst processors.The multigrid technique
            then utilizes such info to construct a grid hierachy and
            projection and interpolation operators which become
              fundamental pieces to the overall algorithm. </p>

            <p align="left"> As a simple example of the solver in
              action we can consider Poisson's equation, the
              prototypical elliptic PDE which models diffusive
              processes. Poisson's equation has a strong formulation
              given by: </p>

              $$\nabla u = b(x)$$.

            <p align="left"> For a specific instance we can choose a
            square domain with insulated boundaries which is forced
            internally with some heat source given by: </p>

            $$b(x) = 2\pi^2 \sin(\pi x)\sin(\pi y)$$.

            <p align="left"> This gives rise to a solution as depicted
            in the following: </p>

            <br>

            <img src="imgs/forced_2d.svg" alt="2D Forced Poisson solution">

            <br>

            <p align="left"> As expected, this gives rise to optimal
              convergence rates which we can inspect by comparing our
              computed solution to an exact solution generated via the
              method of manufactured solutions. As we can see, one
              application of FMG produces a solution on the order of
              the discretization error. </p>

            <img src="imgs/vcycle_vs_fmg.svg" alt="V cycles vs FMG convergence">

            <p align="left"> We can similarly study more exotic
            physics. For example here we consider thermally driven
            flow which encorporates a Boussinesq buoyancy
            approximation which couples an energy balance equation to
            that of the incompressible Navier Stokes equations. In the
            figure below we can observe the formation of thermal
            vortices, a phenomena which is particularly difficult for
            black box solvers to resolve. </p>

            $$
            \begin{aligned}
            \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t} + (\boldsymbol{u} \cdot \nabla)\boldsymbol{u} &- \mu \nabla^2 \boldsymbol{u} + \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p = - \beta \textbf{g} T \\
            \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u} &= 0 \\
            \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{u}\cdot \nabla T &- \nabla \cdot (k\nabla  T) = \frac{J}{\rho c_p}
            \end{aligned}
            $$

                 width="600"  align="center">

            <p align="left"> We can also apply these ideas to
            elastodynamics problems.  </p>

            $$
            \begin{aligned}
            \rho_0 \ddot{\boldsymbol{\phi}} = \nabla^\textbf{X} \cdot [\textbf{P(F)}] &+ \rho_0 \textbf{b}_m \quad \text{ in } B\times (0,\tau) \\
            \boldsymbol{\phi} &= \textbf{g} \quad \text{ in } \Gamma_d \times (0,\tau) \\
            \textbf{P(F)}\textbf{N} &= \textbf{h} \quad \text{ in } \Gamma_n \times (0,\tau) \\
            \boldsymbol{\phi} (\cdot,0) &= \textbf{X} \quad \text{ in } B \\
            \dot{\boldsymbol{\phi}} (\cdot,0) &= \textbf{V}_0 \quad \text{ in } B
            \end{aligned}
            $$

            <p align="left"> In the above formulation $B$ represents
            the reference configuration and $\textbf{X}$ corresponds
            to the Lagrangian coordinate system. Furthermore,
            $\textbf{P(F)}$ is the first Piola-Kirchoff frame
            indifferent stress response function having $\textbf{F} =
            \nabla^\textbf{X}\boldsymbol{\phi}$, $\rho_0$ is the
            reference mass density, $\textbf{b}_m$ is the material
            description of a specified spatial body force field per
            unit mass, $\textbf{N}$ is the outward unit normal field
            on $\partial B$, and $\textbf{g,h,V}_0$ are perscribed
            fields. </p>

            <p align="left"> Of course there are many possible further
            applications of such a technique which can be explored
            through the introduction of different domains, boundary
            conditions, and couplings between various physics. Having
            the ability to explore such scenarios from the command
            line provides a very fast and robust method for modeling
            and investigating the behaviour and dynamics of various
            problems of interest. </p>
